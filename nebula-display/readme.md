# Ender 3 V3 KE – Replacing Creality GUI with KlipperScreen

## Overview

I own a **Creality Ender 3 V3 KE** equipped with the **Nebula Pad**.  
The Nebula Pad is a **MIPS-based single-board computer (SBC)** with an attached display that runs Creality’s proprietary graphical user interface.

After switching to **mainline Klipper**, the original Creality GUI no longer works.  
The goal of this project is to **replace the non-functional Creality GUI with KlipperScreen** and document the process.

## Hardware

- **Printer:** Creality Ender 3 V3 KE
- **Controller / Display:** Nebula Pad
- **Architecture:** MIPS-based SBC
- **Display:** Integrated touchscreen
